print("Hello World!")

"""

    All programs have to has a EOF (End of File) character. (enter)

    When an error happens, will shou in the subsequent lines:
        -the traceback (which is the path that the code traverses through different parts of the program
                you can ignore it for now, as it is empty in such a simple code);
        -the location of the error (the name of the file containing the error, line number and module name); note:
                the number may be misleading, as Python usually shows the place where it first notices the effects of the error,
                not necessarily the error itself;
        -the content of the erroneous line; note: IDLE s editor window doesnt show line numbers, but it displays the current cursor
                location at the bottom-right corner; use it to locate the erroneous line in a long source code;
        -the name of the error and a short explanation.

    Well done! You've reached the end of Module 1 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education.
        Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and become familiar with in Module 1:

        -the fundamentals of computer programming, i.e., how the computer works, how the program is executed,
                how the programming language is defined and constructed;
        -the difference between compilation and interpretation;
        -the basic information about Python and how it is positioned among other programming languages,
            and what distinguishes its different versions;
        -the study resources and different types of interfaces you will be using in the course.
