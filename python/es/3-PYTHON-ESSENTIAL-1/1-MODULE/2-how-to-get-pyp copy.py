    How to get python and how to get to use it?

    Linux users most probably have Python already installed -
    this is the most likely scenario, as Python's infrastructure is intensively used by many Linux OS components.

    write on linux:
        python3

        if its display something like:
            Python 3.8.2 (default, Jan 19 2021, 14:54:04)
        you have python installed.
    You can search about how to install python on your linux.

    For non-linux users, you can download python from the official website:
        https://www.python.org/downloads/.

    if you are windows user:
        - download python from the official website:
        - Add Python 3.x to PATH

    once you have python installed, you will need the next tools for python development:
        -an editor which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features,
            not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;
        -a console in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when
            it gets out of control;
        -a tool named a debugger, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you
            to inspect it at each moment of execution.

    Besides its many useful components, the Python 3 standard installation
    contains a very simple but extremely useful application named IDLE.

    IDLE is an acronym: Integrated Development and Learning Environment.
