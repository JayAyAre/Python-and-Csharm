    Key takeaways

        1. You can use the sort() method to sort elements of a list, e.g.:

            lst = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
            print(lst)

            lst.sort()
            print(lst)  # outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        2. There is also a list method called reverse(), which you can use to reverse the list, e.g.:

            lst = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
            print(lst)

            lst.reverse()
            print(lst)  # outputs: [5, 4, 2, 1, 3]


        Exercise 1

            What is the output of the following snippet?

                lst = ["D", "F", "A", "Z"]
                lst.sort()

                print(lst)

        Exercise 2

            What is the output of the following snippet?

                a = 3
                b = 1
                c = 2

                lst = [a, c, b]
                lst.sort()

                print(lst)

        Exercise 3

            What is the output of the following snippet?

                a = "A"
                b = "B"
                c = "C"
                d = " "

                lst = [a, b, c, d]
                lst.reverse()

                print(lst)
