    Congratulations! You have completed Module 3.

        Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and got familiar with in Module 3:

        - Boolean values to compare different values and control the execution paths using the if and if-else instructions;
        - the utilization of loops (while and for) and how to control their behavior using the break and continue instructions;
        - the difference between logical and bitwise operations;
        - the concept of lists and list processing, including the iteration provided by the for loop, and slicing;
        - the idea of multi-dimensional arrays.
