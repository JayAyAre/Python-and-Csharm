    Key takeaways

        1. Comments can be used to leave additional information in code. They are ommited at runtime.
            The information left in source code is addressed to human readers with #.

        2. If you want to place a comment that spans several lines, you need to place # in front of them all

        3. Whenever possible and justified, you should give self-commenting names to variables
            Do something like this:

                length - length of the sides of a triangle
                width - width of the sides of a triangle

                and not to do this:
                a - length of the sides of a triangle
                b - width of the sides of a triangle

        4. It's important to use comments to make programs easier to understand.

        5. Comments can be important when you are reading your own code after some time.

        Exercise 1

            What is the output of the following snippet?

                # print("String #1")
                print("String #2")

        Exercise 2

            What will happen when you run the following code?

                # This is
                a multiline
                comment. #

                print("Hello!")
