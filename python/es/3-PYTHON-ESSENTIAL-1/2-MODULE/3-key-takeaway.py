    1. The print() function is a built-in function. It prints/outputs a specified message
        to the screen/console window. If we use it inside another print() function, it will print
        the inside print function, then, the outside print function will print the return
        value of the inside print function. which one return none.
            print(print("Hola"), "adios")

    2. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined functions,
        are always available and don't have to be imported. Python 3.8 comes with 69 built-in functions.
        You can find their full list provided in alphabetical order in the Python Standard Library.
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

    3. To call a function (this process is known as function invocation or function call)
        for this you will have to use the function name followed by parentheses.
        You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses.

    4. Python string are delimited with quotes, like:
        "Hello World"
        'Hello World'

    5. Computer programs are collections of instructions. An instructions is a command to perform
        a specific task when executed.

    6. In Python strings the backslash (\) is a special character which announces that the
        next character has a different meaning, e.g., \n (the newline character) starts a new output line.

    7. Positional arguments are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position.

    8. Keyword arguments are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location.

    9. The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print() function.
        The sep parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments, e.g., print("H", "E", "L", "L", "O", sep="-"),
        whereas the end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement
