    The literal

        A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself

        For example: 123
        The value it represents is 123

        For example: c
        Does it represent any value? it can be a constant or the symbol of the speed of light
        there are many posibilities.

        You use literals to encode data and to put them into your code
        We're now going to show you some conventions you have to obey when using Python.

print("2")
print(2)

"""
    If we execute that coode, we will see that the output is 2.

    there are two identical lines but with two diferents literals.

        - A string, which you already know.
        - And an integer number, something completely new.

    Internally, in the computer's memory, these two values are stored in completely different ways
    the string exists as just a string - a series of letters.

    The number is converted into machine representation (a set of bits).
    The print() function is able to show them both in a form readable to humans.
