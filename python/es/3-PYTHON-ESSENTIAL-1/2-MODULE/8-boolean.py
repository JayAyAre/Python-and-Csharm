    Booleans
        To conclude with Python's literals, there are two additional ones.

        to prove truthfulness, we have to use the booleans.
        Each time you ask Python if one number is greater than another,
        the question results in the creation of some specific data - a Boolean value.

        True and False, denoted as 1 and 0.

        Computers know only two kinds of answers:

            Yes, this is true;
            No, this is false.

        Python, then, is a binary reptile.

        These two Boolean values have strict denotations in Python:
            True
            False

        You cannot change anything - you have to take these symbols as they are,
        including case-sensitivity.

        print(True > False)
        print(True < False)
