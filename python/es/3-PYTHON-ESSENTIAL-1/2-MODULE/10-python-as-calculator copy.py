    Python as a calculator

        The print function can be used to print the result of an expression.
        For example, the following expression prints the result of the addition of 2 and 3:
        print(2 + 3)

        Taking it more seriously, we are now entering the province of operators and expressions.

    Basic operators

        An operator is a symbol of the programming language, which is able to operate on the values.

        the + (plus) operator is used to add two values.
        the - (minus) operator is used to subtract two values.
        the * (multiply) operator is used to multiply two values.
        the / (divide) operator is used to divide two values.
        the % (modulo) operator is used to find the remainder of the division of two values.
        the ** (power) operator is used to raise a value to a power.
        the // (floor division) operator is used to divide two values and return the floor of the result.

    Remember: Data and operators when connected together form expressions.
    The simplest expression is a literal itself.
