    Strings

        Strings are used when you need to process text, and not numbers,
        always the strings are enclosed in quotes.

        for example:
            "Hello World"
            'Hello World'

        Its important to note that the quotes are not part of the string.
        if we want to write some quotes inside a string, we have to use the escape character.

        like this:
            I like "Monty Python"

            print("I like \"Monty Python\"")

        The second solution may be a bit surprising. Python can use an apostrophe instead of a quote.
        Either of these characters may delimit strings, but you must be consistent.

        print('I like "Monty Python"')

        Another example:
            print("I'm Monty Python.")
            print('I\'m Monty Python.')

"""

print("I'm Monty Python.")
print('I\'m Monty Python.')
print("I like \"Monty Python\"")
