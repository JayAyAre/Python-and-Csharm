print("Hello World!")

"""
As you can see, the first program consists of the following parts:

    -the word print;
    -an opening parenthesis;
    -a quotation mark;
    -a line of text: Hello, World!;
    -another quotation mark;
    -a closing parenthesis.
    -Each of the above plays a very important role in the code.

    The word print is a function name, but that dont means that wherever the word appears, it is always a function name.
    The meaning of the word comes from the context in which the word has been used.

    Python functions, however, are more flexible, and can contain more content than their mathematical siblings.

    A function (in this case) is a separate part of the computer code able to:
        - Cause some effect
        - Evaluate a value and return it as the function's result; this is what makes
            Python functions the relatives of mathematical concepts

    Where do the functionts came from?
        - They may come from python itself.
        - They may come from one or more of pythons add-ons named modules.
        - You can write them yourself.

    The name of the function should be significant (the name of the print function is self-evident).

    The print() function
        As we said before, a function may have:

        an effect;
        a result.

        Also exist somethin very important, the arguments.
        Mathematical functions have one argument, like sin (x)

        Python functions, on the other hand, are more versatile. Depending on the individual needs, they may accept
        any number of arguments - as many as necessary to perform their tasks.
        Note: any number includes zero - some Python functions don't need any argument.

        print("Hello, World!")

        Here we have one argument, inside the parentheses. you will have to place him there.

        The only argument delivered to the print() function in this example is a string:

        As you can see, the string is delimited with quotes - in fact, the quotes make the string -
        they cut out a part of the code and assign a different meaning to it.

        with the function name and the parentheses, you make the function invocation.
            function_name(argument)

        What happens when Python encounters an invocation like this one up there?
            -Python checks if the name specified is legal;
            -Python checks if the functions requierements for the number of arguments allows you to
                invoke the function in this way
            -python leaves your code for a moment and jumps into the function
            -the function executes his code
            -python returns to your code and continues its execution
